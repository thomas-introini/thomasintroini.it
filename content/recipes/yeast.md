## Ingredients
- 100g of Natural yeast starter
- 100g of Type 1 Flour (Currently I'm using the [Milleusi Bio by Molino Pivetti](https://www.molinipivetti.it/prodotto/tipo-1-milleusi-bio/))
- 50g of filtered Water

## Instructions

1. In a bowl, combine the yeast starter and water, stirring until evenly mixed.
2. Add all of the flour.
3. Stir the mixture with a spoon until most of the flour is incorporated.
4. Transfer the dough to a cutting board and fold it repeatedly until it becomes smooth and velvety.
5. Shape the dough into a ball.
6. Discard any excess yeast starter or reserve it for making sourdough bread.
7. Place the dough into a container.
8. Let it rest for 1 hour.
9. Refrigerate for up to 7 days.
